# Lesson 1: default interfaces

##Â given: two interfaces with same (default) method signature

## solution

- A superclass wins always against the supertype ( if a class inherit a method from a superclass and a supertype)  --> true for concrete and abstract classes
- subtypes wins over supertype --> a class inherits a method from two supertypes and one is the supertype of the other
- in all other cases you need to implement the default method
